Traditional data center:Everything we have to maintain eg:storage,os,servers,network etc
infrastructure as a service:
severers and maintainance take care by cloud eg:os,virtualisation,servers,storage,network...these given by cloud ..remaining we have to take care
platform:
along infrastucture runtime and middleware is provided i.e., we will deploy and maintain it
software:
nothing we have to maintain.. we wwill based on the uasge

services redis,mysql,mongodb 
framework java ,spring,node

2 cloud types:
1.public
less cost
2.private 
high costeg:IBM cloud
and other hybrid cloud also there

*cloud is language independent
*its a open source achieved by buidpacks

cloud foundary: we can ineract with cloud in 3 ways
1)web console
2)CLI:(command line inetrface)
to check it is installed or not
in cmd
cf --version
to intaract with cloud cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io ...using this we have to login
change cmd to specified path where our app. is present
to push app. to cloud
cf push <appname> -n <hostname> -i <no.of instances> -m <memory> -p <pathof war>
eg:cf push spring-music -n spring-music-sowji271 -i 1 -m 1024m -p spring-music.war
we can also enter build pack details -b <buildpack>

when we push using cf push it goes to router(validate our url which we entered like sowji271)
and forwards the request to cloud controller
cloud controller manages 2..
1.cloud controller db(CCDB)
all meta data(no.of instances,host,memory,path,buildpack) goes to CCDB
The entire war along with 1 droplet dropped into BLOB

BLOB(binary large OBject):
create a many DEA(droplet Execution Agent)....one DEA has many warden/garden containers...these are stakelessi.e., independent
the droplet is dropped into wraden/garden cntainers

To our application wnats to consume we have service broker and health manager
once app is deployed health manger moniters this work
messaging ,login take care by service broker

entire communication is happen through bus called NATS

to see deployed apps
cf apps
cf delete -f <app-name>
cf stop
for help
Eg:cf help command( push,stop)
cf target-to switch spaces
cf org-to switch org
cf create-space testing ----to  create another space for testing,devolopment or production
cloud OS is BOSH

3)IDE like eclipse,sts
remove the existing server
and add our pivotal web services account and validate
then run the app on server it automatically deploys into cloud



devoloper benifit---stop,refresh..
operator benefits--install and manage, target multiple clouds

Application--unit of deployment
buildpacks---language independent is bcz of this...based on app we deploy it deducts the required build packs
Manifests---carries metadata
Organisation---work under multiple environment spaces(devoloment,testing,production) with supporting servers
Organisation roles--1.Org. Auditor---can have view access
2.Org. manager--can manage

Application Space Roles:
Space Manager
Space Devoloper--can delete,create,manage,full access to app.
Space Auditor

Administrator user/roles:
Quotas:total memory
Domain:cfapps.io,apps.internal,cf-tcapps.io we can new domain like swoko.com
Services:db,messaging,mail...
